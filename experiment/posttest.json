        "d": "The diameter is half the radius"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The diameter is always twice the length of the radius.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would mean the radius is larger than the diameter.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is only true for a point, not a circle.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The area of a square is side * side, so 4 * 4 = 16.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would be the perimeter of a square with side length 2.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is not the area of the square.",

      "question": "Why is the Monte Carlo method considered a probabilistic method?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it uses random numbers to find a solution",
        "b": "Because it always gives the exact same answer",
        "c": "Because it is a very old method",
        "d": "Because it was invented by a gambler"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The use of random sampling is the defining characteristic of Monte Carlo methods.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Due to its random nature, it gives slightly different results each time.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Its age doesn't make it probabilistic.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While it has roots in games of chance, that's not the reason for the name."

        "c": "Its distance from the center is equal to the radius",
        "d": "It is colored red"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. A point is inside the circle if its distance from the center is less than the circle's radius.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would mean the point is outside the circle.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would mean the point is on the circle's circumference.",

      "question": "If you run the experiment twice with 1000 points each time, would you expect to get the exact same estimate for Pi? Why?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No, because the points are generated randomly each time",
        "b": "Yes, because the number of points is the same",
        "c": "Yes, because the formula for Pi is constant",
        "d": "No, because the computer makes errors"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The random nature of the point generation will lead to slightly different outcomes.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The number of points affects the accuracy, but not the exact outcome.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The formula is constant, but the random sampling is not.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While computers can make errors, the primary reason for the difference is the randomness."

        "a": "Generate a very large number of points",
        "b": "Use a very small number of points",
        "c": "Use a faster computer",
        "d": "Use a different shape instead of a circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The more points you use, the closer your approximation will be to the true value of Pi. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers' target='_blank'>Read more here.</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. A small number of points will give a very rough estimate.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A faster computer will do the calculation quicker, but won't improve the accuracy for a given number of points.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The relationship between the circle and square is key to this method."

      "question": "Imagine you have a 3D sphere inscribed in a cube. How could you adapt the Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Generate random points in the cube and find the ratio of points inside the sphere to the total points",

        "d": "Count the vertices of the cube and sphere"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The ratio of the volumes (Volume(sphere) / Volume(cube)) can be used to estimate Pi. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3 and a cube is (2r)^3 = 8r^3. The ratio is (4/3)πr^3 / 8r^3 = π/6.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The Monte Carlo method is applicable in any number of dimensions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A 2D projection would not capture the 3D nature of the problem.",

        "b": "The computer's inability to draw perfect circles",
        "c": "Rounding errors in the value of Pi itself",
        "d": "The square not being perfectly aligned"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The main source of error is that we're using a finite sample to estimate a theoretical ratio, leading to statistical variance.",
        "b": "Incorrect. We're not actually drawing circles; we're using mathematical calculations.",
        "c": "Incorrect. We're estimating Pi, not using its value in calculations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The alignment is mathematically defined and precise."

    {
      "question": "If your experiment with 10,000 points gives an estimate of Pi = 3.15, and another run gives Pi = 3.13, what does this tell you?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Both estimates are reasonable given the random nature of the method",
        "b": "One of the experiments must have an error in the code",
        "c": "The true value of Pi changes between experiments",
        "d": "You should always use the higher estimate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Random sampling naturally produces variation around the true value. Both estimates are within expected statistical bounds.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Variation in results is expected and normal for Monte Carlo methods.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Pi is a mathematical constant that never changes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Neither estimate is necessarily better; averaging multiple runs might give a better estimate."

    {
      "question": "How does the convergence rate of the Monte Carlo method for Pi compare as you increase the number of points?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The error decreases proportionally to 1/√n, where n is the number of points",
        "b": "The error decreases proportionally to 1/n, where n is the number of points",
        "c": "The error remains constant regardless of the number of points",
        "d": "The error increases as you add more points"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Monte Carlo methods typically have a convergence rate of O(1/√n), which is relatively slow but applies to any dimensionality.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would be much faster convergence than Monte Carlo methods typically achieve.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Adding more points definitely improves the estimate.",
        "d": "Incorrect. More points lead to better, not worse, estimates."

        "c": "Running multiple experiments and averaging the results",
        "d": "Using a better random number generator"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Changing the ratio between the square and circle would actually break the method, as the mathematical relationship π/4 depends on the circle being inscribed in the square.",
        "b": "Incorrect. More points always improve accuracy on average.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Averaging multiple independent runs reduces variance and improves the estimate.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A better random number generator ensures better distribution of points."

      "question": "What practical limitation might you encounter when trying to use 1 billion points to estimate Pi?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Computational time and memory resources required",

        "c": "The random number generator would stop working",
        "d": "The circle would become too large to fit in the square"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Generating, processing, and potentially storing information about 1 billion points requires significant computational resources and time.",
        "b": "Incorrect. More points generally lead to better accuracy, not worse.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Modern random number generators can produce far more than 1 billion numbers.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The size of the shapes is abstract and doesn't depend on the number of points."

        "c": "Too many points are being generated",
        "d": "The circle is not perfectly round"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Non-uniform distribution of points indicates the random number generator is not producing truly random or pseudo-random numbers with uniform distribution.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The formula doesn't affect point distribution.",
        "c": "Incorrect. More points wouldn't cause clustering if properly randomized.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The circle's definition is mathematical and perfect."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Monte Carlo methods excel at solving high-dimensional problems, integration, and optimization where analytical solutions are impractical or impossible.",
