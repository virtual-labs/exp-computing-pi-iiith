      "question": "What is the relationship between the radius and diameter of a circle?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The diameter is twice the radius",
        "b": "The radius is twice the diameter",
        "c": "The radius and diameter are equal",
        "d": "The diameter is half the radius"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The diameter is always twice the length of the radius.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would mean the radius is larger than the diameter.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is only true for a point, not a circle.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is the reverse of the correct relationship."

      "question": "If a square has a side length of 4 units, what is its area?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "16 square units",
        "b": "8 square units",
        "c": "12 square units",
        "d": "4 square units"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The area of a square is side * side, so 4 * 4 = 16.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would be the perimeter of a square with side length 2.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is not the area of the square.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is the side length, not the area."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. This is a common approximation of Pi.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is the value of Euler's number, e.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is the golden ratio.",

    {
      "question": "Why is the Monte Carlo method considered a probabilistic method?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it uses random numbers to find a solution",
        "b": "Because it always gives the exact same answer",
        "c": "Because it is a very old method",
        "d": "Because it was invented by a gambler"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The use of random sampling is the defining characteristic of Monte Carlo methods.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Due to its random nature, it gives slightly different results each time.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Its age doesn't make it probabilistic.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While it has roots in games of chance, that's not the reason for the name."

    {
      "question": "In the context of the Pi experiment, what does a point being 'inside the circle' mean?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Its distance from the center is less than the radius",
        "b": "Its distance from the center is greater than the radius",
        "c": "Its distance from the center is equal to the radius",
        "d": "It is colored red"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. A point is inside the circle if its distance from the center is less than the circle's radius.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would mean the point is outside the circle.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would mean the point is on the circle's circumference.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The color is just for visualization."
      },

      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "If the area of the square is 4 and the area of the inscribed circle is π, what is the ratio of the areas?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "π/4",
        "b": "4/π",
        "c": "π",
        "d": "4"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The ratio is Area(circle) / Area(square) = π / 4.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is the reciprocal of the correct ratio.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is the area of the circle.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is the area of the square."

    {
      "question": "If you run the experiment twice with 1000 points each time, would you expect to get the exact same estimate for Pi? Why?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No, because the points are generated randomly each time",
        "b": "Yes, because the number of points is the same",
        "c": "Yes, because the formula for Pi is constant",
        "d": "No, because the computer makes errors"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The random nature of the point generation will lead to slightly different outcomes.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The number of points affects the accuracy, but not the exact outcome.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The formula is constant, but the random sampling is not.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While computers can make errors, the primary reason for the difference is the randomness."

    {
      "question": "If you wanted to estimate the value of Pi to a very high degree of accuracy using this method, what would you need to do?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Generate a very large number of points",
        "b": "Use a very small number of points",
        "c": "Use a faster computer",
        "d": "Use a different shape instead of a circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The more points you use, the closer your approximation will be to the true value of Pi. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers' target='_blank'>Read more here.</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. A small number of points will give a very rough estimate.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A faster computer will do the calculation quicker, but won't improve the accuracy for a given number of points.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The relationship between the circle and square is key to this method."

    {
      "question": "Imagine you have a 3D sphere inscribed in a cube. How could you adapt the Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Generate random points in the cube and find the ratio of points inside the sphere to the total points",
        "b": "It's not possible to use the Monte Carlo method in 3D",
        "c": "Draw a 2D projection and use the same method",
        "d": "Count the vertices of the cube and sphere"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The ratio of the volumes (Volume(sphere) / Volume(cube)) can be used to estimate Pi. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3 and a cube is (2r)^3 = 8r^3. The ratio is (4/3)πr^3 / 8r^3 = π/6.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The Monte Carlo method is applicable in any number of dimensions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A 2D projection would not capture the 3D nature of the problem.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Counting vertices would not give an estimate of Pi."
