1.  **Start the simulation:** Click on the "Start" button to begin the experiment.
2.  **Number of points:** Use the slider to select the number of points to be plotted on the graph. The more points you plot, the more accurate your results will be.
3.  **Plot points:** Click on the "Plot Points" button to generate random points on the graph.
4.  **Calculate Pi:** Click on the "Calculate Pi" button to see the estimated value of Pi based on the plotted points.
5.  **Reset:** Click on the "Reset" button to clear the graph and start over.

### Experiment Controls

*   **Number of Points Slider:** This slider allows you to control the number of random points generated in the simulation. A higher number of points generally leads to a more accurate approximation of Pi.
*   **Plot Points Button:** This button initiates the process of generating and plotting the random points within the square.
*   **Calculate Pi Button:** This button calculates and displays the estimated value of Pi based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points.
*   **Reset Button:** This button clears the simulation, allowing you to start a new trial.
